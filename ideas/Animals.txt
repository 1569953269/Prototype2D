Simba
-------------
    A helper companion that gives the player tips and occasional rewards for fulfilling goals and rewards.
    This companion also behaves like a cat, so obviously it wants treats and attention.
    It is a static cat with simple animations. Possibly 32*48 (horizontal) and scaled down.

Rat
-------------
    A putrid, but cute creature that scurries around the city looking for some tasty snacks.
    With a better city infrastructure, this animal may become a lost cause.

Stray cat
-------------
    Self-explanatory
